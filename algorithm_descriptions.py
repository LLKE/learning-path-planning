    "A*": """
    **A*** is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is widely used in many fields of computer science due to its performance and accuracy. A* efficiently finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node by combining the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First-Search.
    """,
    "Theta*": """
    **Theta*** is an any-angle path planning algorithm that extends the A* algorithm. It allows for more direct paths by considering line-of-sight connections between nodes, resulting in paths that are closer to the optimal Euclidean distance.
    """,
    "Hybrid A*": """
    **Hybrid A*** is an extension of the A* algorithm designed for non-holonomic vehicles, such as cars. It takes into account the vehicle's kinematic constraints, allowing it to generate feasible and smooth paths that can be followed by the vehicle.
